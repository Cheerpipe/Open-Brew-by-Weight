**Use at your own risk.** Anyone who builds, installs, configures, or operates
firmware from this repository does so **under their sole responsibility**. The
authors and contributors **accept no liability** for any harm, loss, or damage
whatsoever — including but not limited to **personal injury, death, property
damage, equipment damage, business interruption, or psychological distress** —
arising from the use or misuse of this software, documentation, or any
derivative work.

You are solely responsible for:

- **Designing and building a correct, safe circuit** — suitable relay or contact,
  electrical isolation, ratings, polarity, feedback, and any external safety
  barrier (e.g. K2) appropriate for your machine and jurisdiction.
- **Installing and verifying that circuit** on your equipment before connecting
  to a live espresso machine.
- **Configuring the firmware correctly and safely** — including GPIO assignment,
  compile-time pin maps, polarity, machine circuit limits, and workflow parameters — so
  that paddle readback, machine control, and automatic stop behavior match your
  hardware. GPIO and other safety-critical pin assignments are **not**
  configurable from the Web UI; they must be set in source and verified at
  build time (see [Hardware](docs/HARDWARE.md) and the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md)).

**Espresso machines are inherently hazardous.** A machine such as the La
Marzocco Linea Micra contains **pressurized boilers, hot water, and steam at high
temperature**. Adding automatic or remote control — including brew-by-weight
stop, relay actuation, Wi-Fi commands, and timer-based limits — can increase
risk if wiring, isolation, configuration, or software behavior is wrong.
Malfunction or misconfiguration could leave the brew circuit energized too long,
defeat intended safety interlocks, or cause scalding, flooding, electrical
hazard, or fire. **Do not connect this firmware to mains-powered espresso
equipment unless you understand these risks and have validated your entire
system on the bench first.**

This project provides software and documentation only. It **does not**
certify, warrant, or guarantee safe operation on any machine. No statement in
this repository should be interpreted as professional electrical, plumbing, or
machinery safety advice.

This project was developed with substantial assistance from artificial
intelligence tools. AI helped with design, implementation, documentation, and
testing workflows; human review, hardware validation, and safety judgment remain
the author’s responsibility. Use on real espresso equipment only after you have
verified wiring, isolation, and behavior on your own setup.
